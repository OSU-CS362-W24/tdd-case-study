# Test-Driven Development: A Case Study

This demo is derived from Rob Hess's TDD case study demo in spring term of 2023.

In this repo, we'll explore how TDD works by using it to implement a simple version of the [ROT13 cipher algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13).  To get started with this repo, don't forget to install its dependencies (i.e. Jest) by running `npm install` when you first clone the repo.
